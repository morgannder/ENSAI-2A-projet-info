  "strDescription": "Goldschläger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps (43.5% alcohol by volume or 87 proof; originally it was 53.5% alcohol or 107 proof),[1] a liqueur with very thin, yet visible flakes of gold floating in it. The actual amount of gold has been measured at approximately 13 mg in a 1-Litre bottle of Goldschläger.[2] As of July 2016 this amounts to €0.55 EUR or lower on the international gold market.[3]\r\n\r\nGoldschläger was produced in Switzerland until the 1990s, when the brand was acquired by Diageo, which continued production of Goldschläger schnapps in Italy.[1] Since 2008 it is a brand of Global Brands[4] and produced in Switzerland again.[5] The German word Goldschläger (\"gold beater\"[6]) designates the profession of gold leaf makers, who beat bars of gold into micrometre-thin sheets.",
