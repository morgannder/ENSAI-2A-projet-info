  "strDescription": "The habanero (/ˌhɑːbəˈnɛroʊ/; Spanish: [aβaˈneɾo] (About this sound listen)) is a variety of chili pepper. Unripe habaneros are green, and they color as they mature. The most common color variants are orange and red, but the fruit may also be white, brown, yellow, green, or purple.[1] Typically, a ripe habanero chili is 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 in) long. Habanero chilis are very hot, rated 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale.[2] The habanero's heat, its flavor, and its floral aroma have made it a popular ingredient in hot sauces and spicy foods.",
