  "strDescription": "Midori is a sweet, bright green-coloured, muskmelon-flavored liqueur made by Suntory. It is manufactured in Japan, the United States, Mexico, and France. It was made exclusively in Japan until 1987. Midori is typically 20â€“21% alcohol by volume. Its name is the Japanese word for \"green\". The Midori formulated in France is sweeter than the original Japanese version.\r\n\r\nAs it is extremely sweet, Midori is not usually taken \"straight\"; it is generally used in a cocktail, e.g., the Japanese slipper, which is a cocktail composed of lemonade, fresh lemon juice, lime juice, pineapple juice, or orange juice. Sour flavours are often combined with Midori in order to balance out its sweetness.\r\n\r\nMidori was launched by Suntory at Studio 54 in New York City in 1978 during a party held by the cast, crew, and producers of the movie, Saturday Night Fever. By 1983, Midori was distributed in 20 countries. In 2013, following consumer research, Suntory reduced the sugar content and began producing Midori with a redesigned label and frosted glass bottle.",
