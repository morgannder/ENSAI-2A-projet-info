  "strDescription": "Zima Clearmalt is a clear, lightly carbonated alcoholic beverage, that was made and distributed by the Coors Brewing Company. Introduced in 1993, it was marketed as an alternative to beer, an example of what is now often referred to as a cooler, with 4.7%â€“5.4% alcohol by volume. Its production in the United States ceased in October 2008, but it is still marketed in Japan. MillerCoors announced on June 2, 2017 that there would be a limited release of Zima. It is currently for sale for a limited time. Due to the success of the 2017 rerelease, it is likely MillerCoor will be bringing the drink back for summer 2018, but in much larger quantities.\r\n",
