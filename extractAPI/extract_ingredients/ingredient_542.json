  "strDescription": "Prosecco (/prəˈsɛkoʊ, proʊ-/, Italian: [proˈsekko]) is an Italian white wine. Prosecco DOC can be spumante (\"sparkling wine\"), frizzante (\"semi-sparkling wine\"), or tranquillo (\"still wine\"). It is made from Glera grapes, formerly known also as Prosecco, but other grape varieties may be included. The following varieties are traditionally used with Glera up to a maximum of 15% of the total: Verdiso, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Perera, Glera lunga, Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Pinot Grigio and Pinot Nero.\r\n\r\nThe name is derived from that of the Italian village of Prosecco near Trieste, where the grape and wine originated from.\r\n\r\nProsecco DOC is produced in nine provinces spanning the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions. Prosecco Superiore DOCG comes in two varieties: Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG, which can only be made in the Treviso province of Veneto on the hills between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene (north of Treviso), and the smaller Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG, produced near the town of Asolo.\r\n\r\nProsecco is the main ingredient of the Bellini cocktail and can be a less expensive substitute for Champagne. It is also a key ingredient of spritz, a cocktail popular in northern Italy.",
