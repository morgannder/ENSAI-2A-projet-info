  "strDescription": "Fireball Cinnamon Whisky is a mixture of Canadian whisky, cinnamon flavoring and sweeteners that is produced by the Sazerac Company. As of 2018, Fireball is among the top selling whisky brands in the United States. Its foundation is Canadian whisky, and the taste otherwise resembles the candy with a similar name, Ferrara Candy Company's \"Atomic Fireball\" candy. It is bottled at 33% alcohol by volume (66 U.S. proof).\r\n\r\nAccording to the official Fireball website, the product was developed in Canada in the mid-1980s, and for a long time was little known outside of Canada. In addition to the United States and Canada, Fireball is now also available in other countries.",
