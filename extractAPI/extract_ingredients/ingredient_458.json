  "strDescription": "Southern Comfort (often abbreviated SoCo) is an American liqueur made from neutral spirits with fruit, spice and whiskey flavoring. The brand was originally created by bartender Martin Wilkes Heron in New Orleans in 1874. Since March 1, 2016 the brand has been owned by the Sazerac Company after being sold by the Brown-Forman Group. Sazerac has announced that Southern Comfort's formula will be changed in 2017 to include whiskey as an ingredient, as it was until some time before the brand was sold to Brown-Forman in 1979.\r\n\r\nIn the US, Southern Comfort is available as 100 US proof (50% ABV), 70 US proof (35% ABV) and 42 US proof (21% ABV). Southern Comfort Special Reserve, found in duty-free shops, is a blend of Southern Comfort and bourbon, and is 80 US proof (40% ABV). Southern Comfort Lime, released in summer 2010, is 55 proof (27.5% ABV) (UK 2013 20% ABV) and Southern Comfort Bold Black Cherry, released in summer 2012, is 70 proof (35% ABV).\r\n\r\nSouthern Comfort also produces ready-to-pour cocktails available in the US including Southern Comfort Sweet Tea, Southern Comfort Hurricane and Southern Comfort Lemonade, which are all 30 proof (15% ABV).\r\n\r\nSouthern Comfort has expanded over the years and has several product offerings globally.
