  "strDescription": "Lemonade is any of various sweetened beverages found around the world, all characterized by lemon flavour.\r\n\r\nMost lemonade varieties can be separated into two distinct types: cloudy and clear; each is known simply as \"lemonade\" (or a cognate) in countries where dominant. Cloudy lemonade, generally found in North America and India, is a traditionally homemade drink made with lemon juice, water, and sweetener such as cane sugar or honey. Found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, clear lemonade is a lemon flavoured carbonated soft drink. It should not be confused with Sprite, a lemon-lime flavoured soft drink.\r\n\r\nA popular cloudy variation is pink lemonade, made with added fruit flavours such as raspberry or strawberry among others, giving a distinctive pink color. The \"-ade\" suffix may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade, orangeade, or cherryade. Alcoholic varieties are known as hard lemonade.\r\n\r\nIn many European countries, the French word limonade has come to mean \"soft drink\", regardless of flavour.[citation needed]",
