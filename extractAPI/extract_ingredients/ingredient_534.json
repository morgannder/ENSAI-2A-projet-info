  "strDescription": "Yukon Jack is a liqueur advertised as the \"Black sheep of Canadian Liquors\". It is a 100 proof (in USA) or 80 proof (in Canada) drink, made from Canadian whisky and honey. The taste is sweeter than straight whisky and bourbon, due to the honey that is added.\r\n\r\nYukon Jack was formerly imported to the USA by Heublein Inc. Heublein was later taken over by Diageo.\r\n\r\nYukon Jack has been selected as the regimental liqueur of the South Alberta Light Horse. This commemorates the stationing in Whitehorse, Yukon in the 1950s of one unit of the regiment's predecessor, the 19th Alberta Dragoons.",
