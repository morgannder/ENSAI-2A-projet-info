  "strDescription": "The Gatorade Company, Inc. is an American manufacturer of sports-themed beverage and food products, built around its signature line of sports drinks. Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo and is distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida to replenish the carbohydrates that the school's student-athletes burned and the combination of water and electrolytes that they lost in sweat during rigorous sport activities.\r\n\r\nOriginally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1987, which, in turn, was bought by PepsiCo in 2000. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCoâ€™s 4th-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It competes with Coca-Cola's Powerade, Vitaminwater brands worldwide, and with Lucozade Sport in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 75% of market share in the sports drink category.",
