  "strDescription": "Grenadine is a commonly used, non-alcoholic bar syrup, characterized by a flavour that is both tart and sweet, and by a deep red colour. It is popular as an ingredient in cocktails, both for its flavour and to give a reddish/pink tint to mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThe name grenadine originated from the French word grenade which means pomegranate, with pomme meaning apple and granate derived from the Italian word for seeds.\r\n\r\nGrenadine was originally prepared from pomegranate juice, sugar, and water.\r\n\r\nAs grenadine is subject to minimal regulation, its basic flavour profile can alternatively be obtained from a mixture of blackcurrant juice and other fruit juices with the blackcurrant flavour dominating.\r\n\r\nTo reduce production costs, manufacturers have widely replaced fruit bases with artificial ingredients. The Mott's brand \"Rose's\" is by far the most common brand of grenadine sold in the United States,[3] and is formulated from (in order of concentration): high fructose corn syrup, water, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, FD&C Red #40, natural and artificial flavours and FD&C Blue #1. In Europe, Bols still manufactures grenadine with pomegranate.",
